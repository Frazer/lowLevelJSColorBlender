This was a project to investiage altering the color levels on a bmp manually.

See the demo here:
https://frazer.github.io/lowLevelJSColorBlender/source/index.html

Included are 2 bitmaps in 24 bit format.

This current solution only works for 24bit bmp files
See: http://www.di.unito.it/~marcog/SM/BMPformat-Wiki.pdf

Todo: I could adjust convertTo2d function to handle 16 bit bmps, but that is outside the scope of this assignment.
